            whatIs="Incident Response and Malware Analysis will assist you to gauge the influence of cyber breaches. An investigation is necessary, and a containment and recovery technique needs to be carried out by experts. Malware analysis is the process of understanding the behavior and purpose of a suspicious file or URL. The output of the analysis aids in the detection and mitigation of the potential threat. The key benefit of malware analysis is that it helps incident responders and security analysts pragmatically triage incidents and uncover hidden indicators of compromise."

Precious time takes the side bench when you rely on in-house techniques to recover from the incident. A professional is required to handle and mitigate the problem without causing further harm to your organization's data. Malware analysis helps incident responders uncover hidden IOCs that should be blocked and enrich context when threat hunting."
